# NFL Player Stats Radar Chart Web Service

## PROJECT PROPOSAL FORM

1. Project Name: 
   NFL Player Statistics XML/SOAP Web Service with Radar Chart Visualization

2. Project Members:
   - [Team Member Names]

3. Project Aim:
   To develop a web-based XML/SOAP service that enables users to compare NFL players through interactive radar charts, providing a visual and intuitive way to analyze player statistics and performance metrics.

4. General Info About the Organizational Problem:
   NFL teams, analysts, and fans need efficient ways to compare player statistics and performance metrics. Current solutions often present data in tabular formats, making it difficult to quickly grasp relative strengths and weaknesses between players. A visual comparison tool using radar charts would significantly improve the analysis process.

5. Solutions to the Problem:
   - Implement a SOAP web service that provides NFL player statistics in XML format
   - Create radar chart visualizations for comparing up to 3 players simultaneously
   - Metrics to be compared include:
     * Passing yards
     * Rushing yards
     * Touchdowns
     * Completion percentage
     * QB rating
     * Other relevant statistics based on position
   - Enable filtering by position, team, and season
   - Provide both raw XML data and visual representation

6. Software and Hardware to be used in the Project:
   
   Backend:
   - Python 3.x
   - Spyne (SOAP/XML framework)
   - PostgreSQL (existing NFL database)
   - XML, XSD, XSLT technologies
   
   Frontend:
   - HTML5/CSS3
   - JavaScript
   - D3.js for radar chart visualization
   - XML/XSLT for data transformation
   
   Development Tools:
   - Altova XMLSpy Enterprise Edition 2023
   - Git for version control
   - VS Code or similar IDE
   - Postman for API testing

## Technical Implementation Details

### XML/SOAP Features:
- WSDL-first development approach
- XML Schema validation for all requests/responses
- XSLT transformations for data formatting
- SOAP 1.1/1.2 support

### Database Integration:
- Read-only access to existing NFL stats database
- Efficient query optimization for player statistics
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data

### Radar Chart Implementation:
- Dynamic scaling based on stat ranges
- Interactive tooltips showing exact values
- Customizable axes based on player position
- Color-coded player comparisons
- Export capabilities (PNG, SVG)

### Security Considerations:
- Input validation using XML Schema
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Error handling and logging
- Secure database credentials management
